> Last updated: 2026-02-12T19:33:37Z

## Scope

This dashboard tracks the execution state for the V3 release cut from `release/v2` and links evidence artifacts used by release gates.

## Automated Gates

- Readiness gates: `passed`
  - `docs/deployment/reports/readiness-2026-02-12T19-16-21-533Z.json`
- RC gates: `passed`
  - `docs/release/reports/rc-gates-2026-02-12T19-16-43-431Z.json`
- Launch smoke: `passed`
  - `docs/release/reports/launch-smoke-2026-02-12T19-15-23-810Z.json`

## Manual Outputs (Current)

- `release_candidate_tagged`: done (`v3.0.0-rc.0-local`)
- `release_notes_prepared`: done (`docs/release/reports/release-notes-v3-draft-2026-02-12T19-33-37Z.md`)
- `rollback_drill_confirmed`: done (`docs/release/reports/rollback-drill-2026-02-12T19-33-37Z.json`)
- `launch_decision_logged`: done (`docs/release/reports/launch-decision-2026-02-12T19-33-37Z.md`)
- `status_page_updated`: done (`docs/release/reports/status-page-update-2026-02-12T19-33-37Z.md`)
- `rollback_owner_on_standby`: done (`launch-decision` log)

## Cache & Storage Controls

- Service Worker cache version source: `public/sw.js`
- SW version validator: `scripts/pwa/validate-sw-version.mjs`
- Analytics storage summary: `var/analytics/summary.json`
- Production analytics storage path contract: `env.production.example`

## Next Execution Phases

1. Phase 2: Create manual gate evidence artifacts and wire them into release docs. (done)
2. Phase 3: Bump `CACHE_VERSION`, validate SW contract, regenerate release evidence.
3. Phase 4: Re-run readiness/RC/launch suites and finalize go/no-go note.
