# v2.0.0 Post-release Verification — 2026-02-08

## Scope

- Verify final licensing release state on `main`
- Verify CI signal from latest GitHub Actions runs
- Re-run local quality gate (`pnpm ci:quick`)

## Release State Check

- `main` contains merge commit for release prep (`5a76abe`)
- Official tag exists: `v2.0.0`
- `package.json` is on `2.0.0` with `license: SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE`
- Final reports present:
  - `docs/licensing/reports/v2.0.0-release-notes.md`
  - `docs/licensing/reports/v2-license-checklist-execution-2026-02-08-final.md`

## GitHub Actions Snapshot

- Workflow: `ci-core`
- Latest run on `main` (`039a087`) ended `failure`
- Failure point (sampled from `quality` job): `Setup Node`
- Observed pattern: all parallel jobs failed early at node setup stage in that run window

## Local Verification

- Command: `pnpm ci:quick`
- Result: `PASS` (lint + typecheck + unit)
- Unit summary: `57 files`, `236 tests`, all passing

## Conclusion

- Release artifacts and local quality gates are healthy.
- Remote CI needs one follow-up pass to confirm GitHub runner/node setup health after transient failure window.
