# Remaining Execution Tasks - asdev-persiantoolbox

- Last updated: 2026-02-14
- Scope: development environment only (no server-side changes)

## Current State

- Strategic execution stages (A/B/S/L): completed in local docs/evidence.
- Local validation gates: passed (`ci:quick`, `ci:contracts`, readiness/RC/launch runs).

## Remaining Tasks

1. Finalize remote release tag state

- Status: pending external action
- Why remaining: `docs/release/release-state-registry.md` and `final_release_tag_remote` in `docs/release/v3-readiness-dashboard.md` are still `in_progress`.
- Evidence path: `docs/release/reports/v3-publish-tasklist-2026-02-14.md`
- Required action: after final approval, create/publish final release tag on remote and update status to `done`.

2. Complete v2 licensing release checklist

- Status: pending release-cut decision
- Why remaining: checklist items are still unchecked and intended for release cut timing.
- Evidence path: `docs/licensing/v2-license-release-checklist.md`
- Required action: check all checklist items at release cut and attach release notes artifact.

3. Optional production confirmation pack (outside current dev-only scope)

- Status: deferred by policy
- Why remaining: post-deploy runtime checks require real base URL and production environment.
- Suggested evidence path: `docs/deployment/reports/` via `pnpm deploy:post:report -- --base-url=<prod-url>`
- Required action: run only when server changes are allowed.
