  - admin auth tests expanded for unauthenticated/non-admin/admin branches
- Priority 4 UX baseline started:
  - unified `loading/empty/error` states in account/history with reusable async-state component
  - recoverable errors now expose explicit retry actions
- Priority 4 async-state expansion completed for high-traffic tools:
  - `components/features/loan/LoanPage.tsx`

  - `tests/e2e/offline.spec.ts`
  - resilient service-worker readiness retries for transient navigation context resets

- Retry E2E scenarios are gated behind `E2E_RETRY_BACKEND=1` for deterministic fixture-backed execution.
- Client-side timeout guards added for account/history fetch flows to avoid indefinite loading states.
- RTL logical-class cleanup applied on high-traffic financial pages:
  - `components/features/loan/LoanPage.tsx`
