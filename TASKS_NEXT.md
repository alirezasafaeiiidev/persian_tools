# PersianToolbox — Next-Phase Backlog (Reality-Based)

This file summarizes the current next-phase execution stance.

- Canonical task list: `TASKS.md`
- Task specifications: `tasks-next/*.md`
- Real phased plan: `docs/ROADMAP_REAL.md`

## Current Truth

- Completed tasks: `3/24`
- Remaining tasks: `21/24`
- NP0 gate still open: `NP0-04..NP0-10`
- Production/staging runtime is healthy but still on older behavior for multiple disabled surfaces.

## Execution Rule

Complete NP0 first, then NP1, then NP2.
No timeline commitments here; only dependency-driven sequencing.
