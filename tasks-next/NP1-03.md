## Title

Observability baseline: request IDs + structured logs (same-origin)

## Context

At scale, debugging needs consistent request correlation without third-party services.

## Steps

1. Add request ID generation in middleware (or server utilities) and include in responses/logs.
2. Standardize server log format for API routes (JSON logs).
3. Document log locations/rotation for VPS deploy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every API response includes a request ID header.
- Logs can be correlated to requests.

## Dependencies

- None.

## Files to modify

- `middleware.ts`
- `app/api/*`
- `ops/deploy/*` (log rotation notes)
- `docs/technical/*`
