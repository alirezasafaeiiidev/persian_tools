## Title

Remove/merge redundant GitHub workflows to reduce CI duplication

## Context

Multiple workflows overlap in purpose, increasing CI time and maintenance load.

## Steps

1. Choose canonical workflow set (likely `ci-core.yml`).
2. Remove or scope redundant workflows to avoid duplicate lint/test/typecheck.
3. Ensure required checks in branch protection align.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No duplicated CI workload for the same signals.
- Required checks remain comprehensive.

## Dependencies

- None.

## Files to modify

- `.github/workflows/*`
