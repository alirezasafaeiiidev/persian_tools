## Title

Internal-link integrity gate (no dead same-origin links)

## Context

Broken internal links harm UX and SEO, and currently exist risk-wise because some routes are disabled while components link to them. Add an automated “same-origin link exists” gate.

## Steps

1. Create a script to scan runtime code (`app`, `components`, `features`, `shared`) for `href="/..."` and `<Link href="/...">`.
2. Validate targets exist under `app/` OR are explicitly feature-flagged.
3. Integrate script into `pnpm ci:contracts` (deploy-blocking).

## Acceptance Criteria

- CI fails when a new broken internal link is introduced.
- Exceptions are explicit and reviewed.

## Dependencies

- Complements NP0-03.

## Files to modify

- `scripts/quality/*` (new)
- `package.json`
- `docs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` (optional)
