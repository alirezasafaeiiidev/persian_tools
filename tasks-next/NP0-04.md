## Title

Restore monetization surfaces coherently (support/ads/plans/account)

## Context

Monetization components exist but critical routes are disabled:

- `app/support/page.tsx` → 404
- `app/ads/page.tsx` → 404
- `app/plans/page.tsx` → 404
- `app/account/page.tsx` → 404
  Subscription APIs also return 410.

To reach 10/10, monetization must be either:

- fully disabled with no dead links and clear UX, OR
- enabled with a consistent minimal path (Local‑First compatible).

## Steps

1. Decide monetization mode:
   - Support-only (donations/sponsor + offline license), or
   - Subscriptions (online-required billing) + offline license.
2. Implement routes accordingly (no 404 for linked pages).
3. Mount consent UX globally (ads/analytics opt-in).
4. Ensure `/pro` gating + offline license issuance ops are documented and testable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No monetization CTA leads to 404/410 unexpectedly.
- Local‑First promise remains intact for free tools.
- Monetization mode is controlled by feature flags and documented.

## Dependencies

- Depends on NP0-03 (feature availability framework).

## Files to modify

- `app/support/page.tsx`
- `app/ads/page.tsx`
- `app/plans/page.tsx`
- `app/account/page.tsx`
