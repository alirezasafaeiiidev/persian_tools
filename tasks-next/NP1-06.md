# ID: NP1-06

## Title

Admin surface re-enable plan (secure, minimal, local-first)

## Context

Admin allowlist and site settings storage exist, but UI/API are disabled. Define and implement a minimal, secure admin surface for production operations.

## Steps

1. Decide admin auth:
   - allowlisted session users, or
   - offline-license-based access + admin secret
2. Re-enable admin pages and APIs behind feature flags.
3. Add tests for auth boundaries and rate limiting.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Secure, operationally usable admin settings update path.

## Dependencies

- Depends on NP0-03.

## Files to modify

- `app/admin/*`
- `app/api/admin/*`
- `lib/server/adminAuth.ts`
- `lib/server/siteSettings.ts`
