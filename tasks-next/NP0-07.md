## Title

Offline‑Guaranteed contract and SW shell generator

## Context

Service worker exists and offline fallback works, but Offline‑Guaranteed tier should be enforced by contract (what routes/assets must work offline after first use). Current `SHELL_ASSETS` is hand-maintained.

## Steps

1. Define an Offline‑Guaranteed contract list:
   - core routes (home, hubs, offline page)
   - top tool routes
   - required assets (fonts, workers, icons)
2. Generate `SHELL_ASSETS` at build time from the registry (no runtime dependency).
3. Add CI contract tests validating:
   - generated list includes required routes
   - list stays within a size budget
4. Expand e2e offline tests to cover deep tool routes reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Offline‑Guaranteed routes load offline after an initial warmup session.
- SW cache versioning remains enforced.

## Dependencies

- None.

## Files to modify

- `public/sw.js`
- `lib/tools-registry.ts`
- `scripts/pwa/*` (generator)
- `tests/e2e/offline.spec.ts`
