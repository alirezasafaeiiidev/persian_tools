## Title

Release automation: generate readiness report artifacts locally

## Context

The repo has readiness reports and contracts, but the workflow is CI-centric. Provide a local command that generates the same artifacts to speed up iteration.

## Steps

1. Add a single script/command that runs:
   - lint/test/build/security scan/lighthouse
   - produces readiness summary under `docs/deployment/reports`
2. Ensure output contracts match CI artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Operators/devs can run a “pre-release gate” locally and get the same report shape as CI.

## Dependencies

- None.

## Files to modify

- `scripts/deploy/*`
- `package.json`
- `docs/deployment/*`
