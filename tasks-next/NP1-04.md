## Title

SEO audits: canonical/robots/schema validation in CI

## Context

SEO is a major growth channel. Many SEO primitives exist (sitemap, JSON-LD, canonical), but they need CI validation to prevent regressions.

## Steps

1. Add tests to validate:
   - every indexable tool route has canonical metadata
   - JSON-LD renders on tool routes
   - robots/sitemap consistency (noindex routes excluded)
2. Add a minimal “SEO crawl” e2e that hits key routes and checks for missing meta tags.

## Acceptance Criteria

- CI fails on missing canonical/robots/schema for indexable routes.

## Dependencies

- None.

## Files to modify

- `tests/unit/*`
- `tests/e2e/*`
