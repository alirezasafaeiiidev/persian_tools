## Title

Cache strategy for data endpoints (ETag/immutable where safe)

## Context

Some same-origin data endpoints are `no-store` (e.g. salary laws feed), which increases origin load at scale and makes client UX more brittle. For Local‑First, data can still be same-origin but should be cacheable safely.

## Steps

1. Identify data endpoints and classify:
   - immutable (versioned) → long cache with ETag
   - mutable but infrequent changes → short cache + revalidate
2. Implement ETag/If-None-Match support and appropriate cache headers.
3. Update clients to handle 304 correctly.
4. Add tests for cache headers and version behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Origin load reduced for repeated reads.
- Data freshness rules are explicit and tested.

## Dependencies

- None.

## Files to modify

- `app/api/data/salary-laws/route.ts`
- `data/salary-laws/*`
- `components/features/salary/SalaryPage.tsx`
- `tests/unit/*`
