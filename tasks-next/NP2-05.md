## Title

Stress test harness (local) for 100k-DAU-like burst simulation

## Context

To validate scale changes (analytics storage, rate limits, caching), add a local harness that simulates burst traffic to same-origin APIs without third-party services.

## Steps

1. Add a Node script that:
   - spawns concurrent requests to `/api/analytics`, `/api/health`, data endpoints
   - records latency/error rates
2. Add a “safe default” mode that runs quickly in CI (optional).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provides reproducible signals for scale regressions.

## Dependencies

- None.

## Files to modify

- `scripts/load/*` (new)
- `docs/performance/*` (optional)
